Forked from https://bitbucket.org/luke/static/

static
======

A really simple WSGI way to serve static (or mixed) content.

See docstrings of static module for details.

Changes in this fork
====================

Following features are added:

Custom mimetypes support for StatusApp
---------------------------------------------------------

Used for html 404 errors.

Example:

```python
app = static.Cling('.', not_found=static.StatusApp('404 Not Found', file='./404.html'))
```

Gzip support
-----------------

Automatically detects and sends if gzipped content is
requested and available. Example: `index.html` tries to find `index.html.gz`
in the same directory.

Gzip is disbaled for Pre SP2 IE6 and IE5 browsers. Read more here:

Expire/Cache-Control headers support
-----------------------------------------------------

For better performance. Trying to keep syntax similar to Apache's
`ExpiresByType`. You can specify the expires headers in
seconds against each mime type.

Example:

```python
EXPIRES = [
    # html
    ('text/html', 0), # No cache

    # feed
    ('application/xml', 60*60), # 1 hour

    # favicon
    ('image/x-icon', 7*24*60*60), # 1 week

    # media
    ('image/gif', 30*24*60*60), # 1 month
    ('image/jpeg', 30*24*60*60), # 1 month
    ('image/png', 30*24*60*60), # 1 month

    # CSS and Javascript
    ('application/javascript', 365*24*60*60), # 1 year
    ('text/css', 365*24*60*60), # 1 year
]
app = static.Cling('.', expire_headers=EXPIRES)
```

Support for setting up charset
---------------------------------------------------------

For better browser rendering performance. Again, trying to keep
it similar to Apache's `AddCharset`. Charset can be set for filename
patterns (file extensions in most of the cases).

Example:

```python
CHARSETS = [
    ('*.html', 'UTF-8'),  # Default for html files
    ('*.ja.html', 'SHIFT_JIS'),
]

app = static.Cling('.', charsets=CHARSETS)
```

Support for custom headers
---------------------------------------------------------

Custom headers can be sent for matching file patterns. Use `*` to
send a specific header with all files.

Example:

```python
CUSTOM_HEADERS = [
    ('*.html', "X-UA-Compatible", "IE=Edge,chrome=1"),
]

app = static.Cling('.', custom_headers=CUSTOM_HEADERS)
```

TODO
====

Here are the suggested features for future:

* Push beyond gzipping (http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/12/pushing-beyond-gzipping/)
* Cache Busting using filename rewrites instead of query strings (http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2008/08/23/revving-filenames-dont-use-querystring/)
